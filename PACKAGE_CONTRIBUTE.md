# Package Contribution

We are a diverse community for holding and co-maintaining unplugin related packages. We welcome everyone to join us and contribute to the community.

If you have an unplugin and you want it to be part of this organization, we are open for it! To ensure the quality of the packages, we have some requirements for the packages to be accepted.

- The package is related to unplugin, and general purposed. Integration with proprietary services might not be accepted.
- The package has at least 100 stars on GitHub, or has at least 3,000 weekly downloads on npm.
- The package is actively maintained and have a good quality.

If you are interested, please open an issue in [this repository](https://github.com/unplugin/.github) to propose your package. We will review it and get back to you as soon as possible.

Once your package is accepted, you will be invited to join the organization. You can then transfer your package to the organization. You will have full access to the repo and package as you are the owner of that package, and you might invite other contributors as out-of-org collaborators for that repo.
